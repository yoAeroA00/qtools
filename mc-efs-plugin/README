				EFS Plugin for Midnight Commander

This plugin allows you to work with the EFS2 filesystem connected to a modem's USB port using the Midnight Commander file panel as if it were a regular file tree.
The operation is performed using the "qefs" utility, which is a part of the qtools suite. The plugin is implemented using the extfs virtual filesystem mechanism,
which is part of MC (Midnight Commander).

Here are the installation steps for the plugin:

1. Edit the "qefs=" line in the "efs+" file by specifying the full path and name of the "qefs" program in your system. If necessary, include the "-p" flag with the name
of the modem's diagnostic port (usually it becomes /dev/ttyUSB0, but not always).

2. Copy the "efs+" file to either /usr/lib/mc/extfs.d/ (to make the plugin available to all users) or ~/.mc/extfs.d/ (to make it available only to the current user).
Ensure that the file has the executable attribute (+x).

3. Insert the modem, make sure the diagnostic port appears in the system, launch Midnight Commander, and in its command line, enter the following command:

    cd efs://
    
That's it. The current panel in MC will display the root directory of EFS2. You can copy, delete, view files, and create/delete directories. Note that renaming is not yet implemented.

Please be aware that executing the cd efs:// command may take a considerable amount of time. This is because the extfs mechanism requires reading the full directory listing from
the modem with all subdirectories. Afterward, MC will work with a local copy of the directory. How to work around this limitation is not currently known.

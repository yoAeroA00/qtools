These bootloaders contain only 1 patch - command 11 (exec), instead of which there used to be a dumb power-off not supported placeholder.
The command format is:

11 00 <up to 1020 bytes of the program to be executed>

Control is passed to the very first byte of the program in ARM mode. The input registers are:

R0 - the address of the program to run
R1 - the address of the response buffer

The program can fill up to 1020 bytes in the response buffer. The output registers are:

R4 - the number of bytes placed in the response buffer.

The original patch source texts are located in the files pexec_*.asm.
